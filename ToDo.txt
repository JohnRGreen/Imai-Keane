To do list:

For figure 2 will need to:
1. Pull in, clean, sort data
2. Divide data into cells based on current wage rate
3. Plot relationship between hours and next period wage ($/hour)



Questions:
1. Do we need to make a 'style guide'?

2. Let's look at All-Appendices.tex and explain what's going on at the top; what kind of document class are we declaring? Why do we input ./econtexRoot two times?

3. If I am confused about a command, what is the best way to search for where it is defined?



1. How do I check if I have a package properly installed? specifically the 'titlesec' package?

2. How to define an equation using a macro, rather than calling it as a subfile?

3. Should I dummy up data for the figures? I may be able to do figure 2 (descriptive) but I will not have enough time to actually reproduce the model, which is what would be required for the remaining figures, which show the fit of the simulation.

4. I want to set up a tmp folder inside of my main directory to store all the .log and .aux docs that get created as a byproduct whenever I compile my document (but which I could conceivably need)

5. Why is my table centered on its own page? (Compiling Section5.tex which calls Table1.tex as a subfile)




What is this /econtexRoot?
I think that \econtexRoot is a command that sends us back to the main BufferStockTheory folder

And \econtexPaths defines the rest of the paths for the project, like \FigDir
Inside we define a series of commands that define all of the needed paths

So to do:
1. set up an /exontexRoot.tex file which defines both commands
   A. \econtexRoot
   B. \econtexPaths
2. set up an /econtexPaths.tex file which defines commands to access the folders:
   A. FigDir
   B. TableDir
   C. Appendices
   D. Data
   E. Slides
   F. Code
   G. Resources
   H. Equations



./Resources/LaTeXInputs contains style guides; not sure if I need this

\onlyinsubfile vs. \notinsubfile
