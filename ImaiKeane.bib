               forms of intertemporally nonseparable utility in the analysis of
               intertemporal labor supply decisions. In this paper, we examine
               whether such nonseparable utility functions are important in
               characterizing microdata on life-cycle labor supply. Using
               longitudinal data on males from the Panel Study of Income

  abstract = "This paper studies several variants of 2 $\times$ 2 games with
              unique mixed strategy equilibria, which we call asymmetric
              matching pennies games. In experimental studies of behavior in
              these games, observed choice frequencies are typically much
              different from the mixed strategy Nash predictions. This paper
              reports experimental results for a variety of such games, and
              shows that a structural econometric model which incorporates risk
              aversion into a quantal response equilibrium explains the data
              very well. Moreover, risk aversion estimates are stable across
              the different games and are close to those obtained from
              laboratory and field auction data, as well as from individual
              lottery choice experiments. Our approach also provides a simple
              test of a model of inequality aversion. A nested model with risk
              aversion yields estimates of the inequality parameters that are
              insignificant.",

  abstract  = "Until recently, inference in many interesting models was
               precluded by the requirement of high dimensional integration.
               But dramatic increases in computer speed, and the recent
               development of new algorithms that permit accurate Monte Carlo
               evaluation of high dimensional integrals, have greatly expanded
               the range of models that can be considered. This chapter
               presents the methodology for several of the most important Monte
               Carlo methods, supplemented by a set of concrete examples that
               show how the methods are used. Some of the examples are new to
               the econometrics literature. They include inference in
               multinomial discrete choice models and selection models in which
               the standard normality assumption is relaxed in favor of a
               multivariate mixture of normals assumption. Several Monte Carlo
               experiments indicate that these methods are successful at
               identifying departures from normality when they are present.
               Throughout the chapter the focus is on inference in parametric
               models that permit rich variation in the distribution of
               disturbances. The chapter first discusses Monte Carlo methods
               for the evaluation of high dimensional integrals, including
               integral simulators like the GHK method, and Markov Chain Monte
               Carlo methods like Gibbs sampling and the Metropolis--Hastings
               algorithm. It then turns to methods for approximating solutions
               to discrete choice dynamic optimization problems, including the
               methods developed by Keane and Wolpin, and Rust, as well as
               methods for circumventing the integration problem entirely, such
               as the approach of Geweke and Keane. The rest of the chapter
               deals with specific examples: classical simulation estimation
               for multinomial probit models, both in the cross sectional and
               panel data contexts; univariate and multivariate latent linear
               models; and Bayesian inference in dynamic discrete choice models

               investment is decreasing throughout life, as in simpler models
               which assume hours of work to be fixed. The demand for leisure
               over the life cycle is ``U shaped.'' Wages rise to a single peak
               which occurs after the peak in hours of work. Distinctly
               different patterns arise when the rate of impatience is high.
               Such individuals may prefer an increasing hours of work profile,
               and schooling need not be concentrated at the beginning of life.
               Conditions are provided to determine a critical level of time

               to the measurement of intertemporal substitution that have
               appeared in the literature. The first approach is to use
               consumption to control for wealth and unobserved expectations
               about future wages in the labor supply equation. The second
               approach is to estimate a first-difference equation for hours in
               which labor supply from the previous period serves as a control
               for wealth and wage expectations. The results indicate that

               positive but small.",

               effect of work experience on wages is explicitly taken into
               account. Because current participation alters future potential
               earnings, the investment return to work will be an important
               factor in the current work decision in any forward-looking
               behavioural model. The model is estimated using the National
               Longitudinal Surveys mature women's cohort. We use the estimates
               of our model to predict changes in the lifecycle patterns of
               employment due to changes in schooling, fertility, husband's
               income, and the magnitude of the experience effect on wages. We
               find that although work experience increases the disutility of
               further work, the effect is overwhelmed by the positive effect
               of experience on wages, leading to persistence in the employment
               patterns of these women. In addition we find that an increase in
